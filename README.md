# TimDemoApp
Hi Backo!

This is a small web application to show my style of coding.

The project that is the startup project is TimDemoApp.Web.

My idea was to show you a solution structure that I often use. It is really just an interpretation of "Uncle Bob"'s "Clean Code". The code also solves a problem where a list of nodes is used to build a tree structure and then show that structure on the web page. Instead of using a real database, I have included a file called "SimulatedDatabase.json" that the app should read the list of nodes from.

The code should be runnable without any edits, so please let me know if you run in to any problems when trying to run it!

Regards, Tim.
